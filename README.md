## Motivation and Problem Definition
Our objective is to develop a predictive model that predicts lung cancer risk based on demographic and lifestyle factors, including age, smoking history, alcohol consumption and other factors. 

## Models Used
- SVM model
- Logistic regression model
- Decision tree classifier
- Random forest classifier
- Neural network

## Conclusions
- Neural Network had the best accuracy while Decision tree classifier had the worst.
- Decision Tree was most affected by skew, while SVM and Logistic Regression were the least affected.

## Future Improvements
- Use a large and balanced dataset.
